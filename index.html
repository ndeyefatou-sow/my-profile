			<h1>Welcome to Ndeye Fatou Sow's universe 👽</h1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.png" id="photo-ndeyefatou">
			<p>There are 4️⃣  planets 🌍 that I frequently visit in my universe. The way of life over there is amazing! Stay tuned to find out which ones they are 😉.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div id="div2-1" class="div2">
			<h2>🌍 Leadership Planet ✊</h2>
			<p>I go very often to the leadership planet. I always knew it existed but I never thought I could visit this planet because it is too far from my home. However, past experiences as children's tutor, class prefects, head organizer of events involving hundreds of people taught me otherwise. I can also be a member of the Leadership Planet: the Leaders!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="div2-2" class="div2">
			<h2>🌍 Literature Planet 📚</h2>
			<p> The Authors, inhabitants of the Literature Planet are some of my dearest friends. I love their lifestyle: everyday, they make pieces that allow me to visit other planets without even physically moving. I love that they allow me to discover foreign cultures!</p>
		</div>

		<div id="div2-3" class="div2">
			<h2>🌍 Sports Planet 🏋️</h2>
			<p>I have visited almost every country of the Sports Planet and I am looking forward to visiting more. Tennis, Fitness, Swimming, Gymnastics were beautiful countires. Beyond allowing me to have the best of funs, they all allowed me to express mydelf with something other tthan words, which turned out to be equally, if not more, satisfying.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div id="div2-4" class="div2">
			<h2>🌍 Pictures Planet 📸</h2>
			<p>Last but certainly not least, we'll be taking a trip to the Pictures Planet. I must say we have some rocky history; at first I hated their favorite meals, cameras, and all who ate it, Photographers, the planet's inhabitant. I did not feel comfortable around them at all! However, after trying their food out, I loved it and it had a positive impact on me: it gave me more confidence. Now, I love being around the Photographers people and I cannot refuse their food!</p>
